## Documentation.

### 1. The Basics
<p>• <strong>Mercurial</strong> was created in 2022 after the creator Ranveer Chaudhary found it difficult to discover new music that matched his taste. He tried various music recommendation apps but none of them seemed to work for him, frustrated with the lack of options, he decided to create his own music recommendation app that would help people like him find new music based on the vibe they seek. </p>

### 2. The UI

<p>• The UI follows the neumorphism design style, with spectacular animations, whilst also keeping user experience (UX) standards and guidelines in mind.</p>

<p>• Taking notes from various applications, the creator finally settled on a swipe based Mechanism. Left swipe for skipping the track and right swipe for liking the track.</p>
